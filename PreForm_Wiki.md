# Best Practices While Using PreForm
#### Welcome Bourns Inc. Intern!
In this wiki, you will learn the best way to handle navigating the challenging world of SLA resin printing.

## What is SLA Printing?
"Stereolithography is a form of 3D printing technology used for creating models, prototypes, patterns, and production parts in a layer by layer fashion using photochemical processes by which light causes chemical monomers and oligomers to cross-link together to form polymers" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography)

Stereolithography: a light-emitting device a) A laser or DLP selectively illuminates the transparent bottom c) of a tank b) filled with a liquid photo-polymerizing resin. The solidified resin d) is progressively dragged up by a lifting platform e).

The main **advantage** of SLA printers is the very fine layer thickness (0.015 to 0.05 mm) compared to FDM (0.1 to 0.5 mm). As the image below shows the resolution of the SLA printing vs FDM. 

The main **disadvantage** of SLA printers are the material sensitivities and warpage due to the cleaning and curing process.

## How to Prepare Export from Creo
#### At Bourns Inc. we use Creo as our flavor of CADing software (comupter-aided design).
Once you've successfully finished CADing the part you wish to prototype, follow the steps below:
1. file -> save as -> save as copy
